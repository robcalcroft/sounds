sounds
======

A web app that plays through any given Soundcloud playlist **[ whilst looking pretty at the same time ]**

It uses the Soundcloud API to load in the the playlist and then I use some lovely JS to traverse between the tracks. 

Clone and have a play!

###Future improvments

- User input to scrubber

- Saving of track position [ have attempted but stuff plays when it shouldn't :/ ]

- Adding robustness
